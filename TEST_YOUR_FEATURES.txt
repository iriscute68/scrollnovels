🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Problem: "I don't see the new features"
Solution: 
  1. Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)
  2. Clear browser cache (DevTools > Application > Clear Storage)
  3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors (F12)
  4. Make sure you're using the correct URLs (check START_HERE.txt)

Problem: "Features show but don't work"
Solution:
  1. Check browser console for errors (F12 > Console tab)
  2. Verify database connection (check config/db.php)
  3. Run: php -l on the PHP files to check for syntax errors
  4. Check that database tables exist with required columns

Problem: "Changes don't stay after refresh"
Solution:
  1. Check browser localStorage (DevTools > Application > LocalStorage)
  2. Verify sessions are working (check $_SESSION in code)
  3. Ensure database connection is working
  4. Check user authentication (make sure you're logged in)

Problem: "Responsive design not working on mobile"
Solution:
  1. Use browser DevTools device emulation (F12 > Device Toolbar)
  2. Check that viewport meta tag is in HTML head
  3. Verify CSS media queries are loading (check Network tab)
  4. Test on actual mobile device if possible

================================================================================
📊 WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING BEHIND THE SCENES
================================================================================

When you change font size:
  1. JavaScript detects change in slider
  2. Saves to browser's localStorage
  3. Also sends to server to save to database
  4. Page displays immediately with new font size
  5. Next time you visit, same font size loads automatically

When you bookmark a book:
  1. JavaScript sends request to server
  2. PHP checks if you're logged in and authorized
  3. Database stores bookmark in user library
  4. Button changes to show "Added"
  5. Your library updates immediately
  6. Persists across all devices after database saves

When you edit a chapter:
  1. JavaScript counts words/characters in real-time
  2. Shows preview of your text
  3. You click "Save Chapter"
  4. PHP validates all input
  5. Database stores the new chapter content
  6. Statistics and content saved permanently
